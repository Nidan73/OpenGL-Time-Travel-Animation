# Time Travel Animation Project

## Description
This project, created using **OpenGL** and **C++**, showcases a fascinating story of time travel. The animated program tells the tale of two friends who discuss the concept of time travel, inspired by Einstein’s theory of relativity. Together, they build a rocket, travel into space, orbit around a black hole, and return to Earth to witness the future.

The project blends storytelling with immersive animations, featuring detailed scenes of rocket launches, celestial elements, and environmental interactions. It also incorporates a dynamic day/night cycle, custom text rendering, and realistic object animations.

## Key Features

### 1. **Storyline Animation**
- Two friends discuss time travel and decide to test the theory by building a rocket.
- They travel into space, orbit a black hole, and return to see Earth’s future.

### 2. **Rocket Launch Animation**
- Smooth, lifelike rocket launches and in-space movements.
- Rockets rotate around the black hole using advanced animation techniques.

### 3. **Black Hole Interaction**
- Realistic black hole representation using OpenGL elements.
- Simulates gravitational pull and light distortions.

### 4. **Dynamic Environment**
- Day and night cycles with interactive toggling.
- Environmental elements such as rivers, hills, trees, stars, and celestial objects.

### 5. **Text Animations**
- Static and dynamic text displays narrating the story.
- Morphed text transitions for immersive storytelling.

### 6. **Custom Graphics**
- Beautifully crafted textures and objects such as houses, garages, cars, and boats.

## Instructions

1. **Launch the Program**:
   - Run the compiled program to start the animation.

2. **Navigate Through the Story**:
   - Follow the journey of the two friends as they build a rocket, travel around a black hole, and return to Earth.

3. **Interact with the Environment**:
   - Toggle between scenes using the `1` to `0` keys on your keyboard.
   - Switch between day and night cycles using keyboard inputs.
   - Explore various environmental features such as cars, boats, and celestial elements.

4. **Enjoy the Animations**:
   - Watch smooth transitions and animations, including rocket launches, black hole rotations, and realistic celestial movements.

5. **Add Images and Resources**:
   - Store images in a designated `resources/images` directory.
   - Update code paths to point to `resources/images` for textures.

## Usage
- **Rocket Launch**: Start the program to see the rocket-building process and launch.
- **Scene Toggle**: Use keys from `1` to `0` to toggle between different scenes.
- **Day/Night Toggle**: Use keyboard input to switch between day and night.
- **Story Progression**: Watch as the story unfolds with text and animations.
- **Interactive Elements**: Explore cars, boats, and environmental components.
